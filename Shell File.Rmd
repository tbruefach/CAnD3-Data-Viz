## Reproducing the Provided Figures

Knitting this shell file will reproduce and save the figures provided in 
the repository. First, it will run the script named **"GGplot Exercise I.R"** to complete the following tasks:  
  
1. Load required packages for analyses and their versions at the time the 
figures were produced (saved with renv).  
2. Load and filter the required data.  
3. Plot and save four figures.
  
```{r, code=xfun::read_utf8('GGplot Exercise I.R')}
```
