## Data Description

***

### Data Source Availabiliy Statement
Data were provided to CAnD3 fellows by Dr. Tim Elrick. 3 primary datasets are 
used, which measure COVID-19 in Canadian regions/provinces, migration in 
Canadian regions/provinces, and economic growth in various nation-states. 
These data are included here in one R data file.

### Files Included for Reproduction

**File Name**             | **Purpose**
--------------------------| -------------------------------------------------
'Shell File.Rmd'          | Calls Scripts to Create Plots within one HTML File
'GGplot Exercise I.R'     | Contains Code used to Create Plots


***

### Instructions for Data Preparation and Analysis
To reproduce the analyses conducted here, download the zip file of this project. 
The zip file will create the folder "CAnD3-Data-Viz." This folder will be 
your working directory. Open the R project titled "CAnD3-Data-Viz.RProj" and 
run (knit) the shell file ('Shell File.Rmd'). This file calls on the script 
"GGplot Exercise I" to produce the four plots found on GitHub.
